# Caldera Data Source

This package provides a layer between the source of data and consumption. The idea is that if the database and other sources of data have the same interface, it will not matter what database -- or API -- the data comes from.

## ðŸ‘€ðŸŒ‹ This Is A Module Of The [Caldera Framework](https://github.com/CalderaWP/caldera)
* ðŸŒ‹ Find Caldera Forms Here:
    - [Caldera Forms on Github](http://github.com/calderawp/caldera-forms/)
    - [CalderaForms.com](http://calderaforms.com)
    
* ðŸŒ‹ [Issues](https://github.com/CalderaWP/caldera/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/CalderaWP/caldera/pulls), should be submitted to the [main Caldera repo](https://github.com/CalderaWP/caldera/pulls).

    
## Overview
This is used in the forms package for the database, but not for the REST API, which is a bad smell that needs corrected.
